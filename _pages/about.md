<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi, I’m Bing Hu. I’m currently a second-year Master’s student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Rui Shao](https://rshaojimmy.github.io/OrionLab/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/) in 2024, advised by Prof. [Jie Wen](https://sites.google.com/view/jerry-wen-hit/home). My research interests include multimodal large language models, reinforcement learning, and embodied AI.

I am currently looking for Ph.D. opportunities in **Embodied AI**, particularly at the intersection of **multimodal foundation models** and **reinforcement learning**.

**LION-FS: Fast & Slow Video-Language Thinker as Online Video Assistant**

Wei Li, **<u>Bing Hu</u>**, Rui Shao\*, Leyang Shen, Liqiang Nie

<!-- LION-FS adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: 1) Fast Path: Routing-Based Response Determination evaluates frame-by-frame whether an immediate response is necessary. 2) Slow Path: Multi-granularity Keyframe Augmentation optimizes keyframes during response generation. -->
